## What is this?

In 2020, me and my siblings gave our dad a Christimas beer calendar as a Father's Day gift. He took it upon himself to then report the rating and a small comment for each beer as he drank them. I wanted a small project to make in React, and this was the result. It's a great overview of what kind of beers he prefers!

You can view the live project [here](https://beer-calendar-react.vercel.app/).
